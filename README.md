# webAnnotation

AI-first web annotation toolkit for turning page feedback into structured code-change context.

`webAnnotation` lets a host web app enter annotation mode, select a DOM element, write a note, and submit an `AnnotationPayload v1` to a configured backend. The long-term goal is to connect those payloads to AI patch generation, PR/MR review, and local CLI patch workflows.

> Status: early MVP in development. The runtime SDK, React source metadata Vite plugin, Node protocol kit, CLI, and local examples exist in this repository. The publishable packages are available on npm at `0.1.0`. The `apps/platform-starter` app and the `examples/*` packages are intentionally private and are not published.

## Current MVP

The repository currently includes:

- `@web-annotation/core`: browser Runtime SDK.
- `@web-annotation/vite`: Vite plugin for React JSX/TSX source metadata.
- `@web-annotation/node`: Node-side protocol kit for payload validation and AI patch context.
- `apps/platform-starter`: a minimal HTTP ingest API (plus a bilingual static task console) that validates payloads, stores tasks, collects repo source context, and proposes mock patches.
- `examples/playground`: a minimal Vite page for local verification.
- `examples/vite-react`: a React + Vite example showing DOM-to-source payloads.
- `examples/provider-http-mock`: a runnable HTTP patch-provider reference plus an end-to-end smoke test.
- TypeScript typecheck, unit tests, and build scripts.

The SDK currently supports:

- `createAnnotator(options)`.
- `enable()`, `disable()`, `isEnabled()`, `mountWidget()`, `destroy()`.
- Hover highlight and click-to-lock target selection.
- A small floating textarea next to the locked element.
- `Enter` to submit, `Shift+Enter` for newline, `Esc` to cancel.
- `submitAnnotation(payload)` custom submission.
- `endpoint` + optional `getAuthToken()` POST submission.
- `AnnotationPayload v1` with project, page, target selector, CSS path, element text, rect, and sanitized DOM snapshot.
- Optional `target.source` when source metadata has been injected by the Vite plugin.
- Optional image attachments: select images in the popup, preview thumbnails, remove them, and see per-image uploading/failed status; images are uploaded before the annotation is submitted (`uploadImage` host hook or a JSON/base64 `uploadEndpoint`), and the payload carries only the uploaded reference — never raw image bytes.
- A small built-in locale mechanism (`locale: "zh" | "en"`, auto-detected from `navigator.language`) for all popup/widget text.

The Vite plugin currently supports:

- React JSX/TSX intrinsic HTML element metadata injection.
- `mode: "source"` for file, line, column, component, framework, and sourceId.
- `mode: "safe"` for browser payloads that include only anonymous sourceId.
- `mode: "disabled"` to skip source metadata injection.
- `include` / `exclude` filters.
- An in-memory manifest callback for mapping sourceId back to source locations on the backend side.

The Node protocol kit currently supports:

- `validateAnnotationPayload(input)` / `assertAnnotationPayload(input)`: runtime validation of `AnnotationPayload v1` with readable issues.
- `validateSourceManifest(input)`: runtime validation of a sourceId-to-location manifest.
- `resolvePayloadSources(payload, manifest)`: enrich safe-mode payloads from a trusted manifest without mutating the input.
- `buildPatchPromptContext(payload, options?)`: a deterministic, serializable summary for AI patch prompts.
- `collectRepoSourceContext(promptContext, options)`: safely read repo source snippets referenced by `source.file`/`line`, with path-traversal/oversize/binary protection and readable issues.
- Image attachment validation in `validateAnnotationPayload`: each `annotations[].attachments[]` image is checked for `kind: "image"`, a non-empty `id`/`name`, an allow-listed `mimeType` (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`), a positive-integer `size`, optional positive-integer `width`/`height`, a `storage` reference (`provider` plus a non-empty `url` or `objectKey`), and rejection of any raw-content field (`data`/`base64`/`content`/…). `buildPatchPromptContext` adds a deterministic per-annotation image summary (name, type, size, dimensions, storage reference) — never raw image content.

The Platform Starter ingest API currently supports:

- `GET /health`: liveness check.
- `POST /api/annotations`: validate a payload (optionally `{ payload, manifest }`), resolve safe-mode sources, store a task, and return `{ taskId, status }`.
- `POST /api/uploads/images`: a minimal JSON/base64 image upload endpoint. Strictly validates the MIME type (`image/png`/`jpeg`/`webp`/`gif`), valid base64, that the bytes are actually an image whose magic bytes match the declared type, and a 5 MiB default size cap; rejects oversized uploads with `413` and bad input with `400`. Stores via the injected `ImageStorageProvider` and returns `{ attachment }` (a stored reference, no raw bytes). Returns `409` when no storage provider is configured. The browser SDK uploads here before submitting the annotation.
- `GET /api/uploads/images/<objectKey>`: serve the bytes of an image stored by a provider that supports retrieval (the in-memory provider does), so console thumbnails resolve. Returns `404` when the object key is unknown or no retrievable provider is configured.
- `GET /api/tasks`: list task summaries (including `status`, source-context counts, any `patchProposalId`, and any `patchReviewStatus`).
- `GET /api/tasks/:id`: fetch task detail, including the generated prompt context, any source context, patch proposal, and patch review.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/source-context`: collect repository source snippets for a task when the server is configured with a repo root.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/patch`: call an injected patch provider to create a patch proposal (idempotent).
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/mock-patch`: generate a deterministic mock patch proposal, moving the task to `patch_proposed` (idempotent).
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/patch-review`: record a human `accept` / `reject` / `changes_requested` decision on a proposal (records the decision only; never applies the patch).
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/patch-artifact`: export a `web-annotation.patch-artifact.v1` JSON artifact for downstream CLI/Git/AI apply workflows (export only; never writes files). When `repoRoot` is configured the artifact's existing `project.commit` field carries the current repo `HEAD`, so the CLI can run a base-commit preflight.
- `GET /` and `GET /console`: a minimal bilingual static-HTML task console for browsing tasks, viewing details, collecting source context, triggering provider/mock patches, reviewing proposals, and viewing patch artifacts.
- `createHttpPatchProvider(options)`: a generic HTTP adapter for connecting an external AI/custom patch service.
- `createOpenAICompatiblePatchProvider(options)`: an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions patch provider. It uses an injectable `fetch` (no real SDK, no outbound calls in tests), requires an explicit `endpoint` and `model` (never guessed), keeps any `apiKey`/`getApiKey` server-side and redacts it from errors, sends the task / prompt context / source context / image-attachment digest as a JSON message, and only accepts the declared `{ summary, suggestedFiles, diffPreview, metadata? }` JSON result (validated, no fallback guessing).
- `ImageStorageProvider` interface with a built-in `createMemoryImageStorage()` test provider. A host injects a real provider (e.g. an OSS-backed one) so an object store can be used without exposing any secret to the browser.
- Shared patch-provider result runtime validation for both direct injected providers and the HTTP/model provider adapters.
- Bilingual task console rendering of image attachment thumbnails/links per annotation (safe `http(s)`/relative URLs only).
- In-memory task store behind a `TaskStore` interface, and a testable `createPlatformServer()` factory.

Still planned:

- Screenshot capture.
- Vue SFC source metadata injection.
- Additional model-specific provider adapters and a production-grade task-console workflow (one OpenAI-compatible adapter exists today).
- A production object-store (e.g. OSS) `ImageStorageProvider` implementation.
- Browser/server detection of image `width`/`height` for the built-in JSON/base64 upload path (today they are populated only when the host's `uploadImage` or upload server supplies them; the field is optional).
- Persistent storage for the platform.
- CLI push and PR/MR delivery (the CLI currently pulls an exported artifact over HTTP, previews artifacts, runs apply dry-run/preflight, checks patch applicability, applies to the working tree with explicit confirmation, and can apply on a new local branch with a local commit).
- npm publishing beyond `0.1.0`: future releases still need the usual version bump, pack/tarball checks, and npm publish flow.

## Install From npm

Install the packages you need from npm:

```sh
pnpm add @web-annotation/core       # browser Runtime SDK
pnpm add @web-annotation/node       # Node-side protocol kit
pnpm add -D @web-annotation/vite    # Vite plugin (React source metadata)
pnpm dlx @web-annotation/cli --help # patch-artifact CLI (run without installing)
```

The `apps/platform-starter` app and the `examples/*` packages are private and are
not published; clone this repository to run them.

## Install Locally

```sh
pnpm install
```

Run the verification suite:

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
```

Run the playground:

```sh
pnpm example
```

Then open the printed local URL, enable annotation mode, select an element, type a note, and press `Enter`. The submitted payload appears in the page and in the console.

Run the React source metadata example:

```sh
pnpm example:react
```

The React example uses the Vite plugin and shows submitted payloads with `annotations[].target.source`.

## Runtime SDK Usage

Use the SDK when you want to collect annotation payloads and send them to your own backend.

```ts
import { createAnnotator } from "@web-annotation/core"

const annotator = createAnnotator({
  projectId: "web-console",
  environment: "staging",
  endpoint: "https://your-api.example.com/annotations",
  getAuthToken: async () => "short-lived-token",
  capture: {
    domSnapshot: true
  }
})

annotator.mountWidget()
```

For advanced integrations, the host app can fully control submission:

```ts
const annotator = createAnnotator({
  projectId: "web-console",
  environment: "staging",
  submitAnnotation: async (payload) => {
    await yourGateway.post("/annotations", payload)
  }
})

annotator.enable()
```

## API

```ts
const annotator = createAnnotator(options)

annotator.enable()
annotator.disable()
annotator.isEnabled()
annotator.mountWidget()
annotator.destroy()
```

### `AnnotatorOptions`

```ts
interface AnnotatorOptions {
  projectId: string
  environment?: string
  release?: string
  commit?: string
  endpoint?: string
  getAuthToken?: () => string | Promise<string>
  submitAnnotation?: (payload: AnnotationPayload) => void | Promise<void>
  capture?: {
    domSnapshot?: boolean
    screenshot?: boolean
    sourceMetadata?: "auto" | "disabled"
  }
}
```

`submitAnnotation` takes precedence over `endpoint`. If neither is provided, submitting an annotation throws a configuration error.

`capture.screenshot` is reserved for a planned package. `capture.sourceMetadata` defaults to `"auto"` and reads metadata only when a build plugin has injected it into the DOM.

### Image Attachments

Enable image attachments in the annotation popup with `attachments.images`. Provide an uploader: `uploadImage` (full host control — e.g. upload to OSS and return the stored metadata) takes precedence over `uploadEndpoint` (a JSON/base64 upload that returns `{ attachment }`). Images are uploaded before the annotation is submitted; if any upload fails the annotation is not submitted, and the user can remove the failed image and resubmit. The payload only ever carries the uploaded reference, never raw image bytes.

```ts
const annotator = createAnnotator({
  projectId: "web-console",
  submitAnnotation: async (payload) => { /* ... */ },
  locale: "zh", // optional; auto-detected from navigator.language otherwise
  attachments: {
    images: true,
    maxImages: 4,                 // default 4
    maxImageBytes: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // default 5 MiB
    acceptedImageTypes: ["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp", "image/gif"], // default

    // Option A: full host control (e.g. upload to OSS, return the reference).
    uploadImage: async (file, context) => ({
      id: "att_…",
      kind: "image",
      name: file.name,
      mimeType: file.type,
      size: file.size,
      storage: { provider: "oss", objectKey: "uploads/…", url: "https://cdn…/…" }
    }),

    // Option B: JSON/base64 endpoint (e.g. the Platform Starter upload route).
    // uploadEndpoint: "https://your-api.example.com/api/uploads/images",
    // getUploadAuthToken: async () => "short-lived-token"
  }
})
```

## Vite Plugin Usage

Use the Vite plugin when you want annotations to carry enough context for an AI or backend service to find the source component.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import { annotationPlugin } from "@web-annotation/vite"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    annotationPlugin({
      mode: "source"
    }),
    react()
  ]
})
```

Production-oriented safe mode keeps real file paths and line numbers out of the browser payload:

```ts
annotationPlugin({
  mode: "safe",
  onManifest: (manifest) => {
    // Store this on your backend or emit it into your own build artifact.
    console.log(manifest)
  }
})
```

Mode behavior:

- `source`: browser DOM and payload include `sourceId`, `file`, `line`, `column`, `component`, and `framework`.
- `safe`: browser DOM and payload include only `sourceId`; the manifest keeps the full mapping for trusted code.
- `disabled`: no source attributes are injected; the Runtime SDK still works with selector and DOM snapshot context.

## Node Protocol Kit Usage

Use the Node kit on your backend or AI layer to validate incoming payloads, resolve safe-mode sources against a trusted manifest, and build deterministic prompt context. It never calls AI APIs, reads model keys, or touches a Git provider.

```ts
import {
  assertAnnotationPayload,
  resolvePayloadSources,
  buildPatchPromptContext,
} from "@web-annotation/node"

// 1. Validate the payload received from the browser (throws on invalid input).
const payload = assertAnnotationPayload(requestBody)

// 2. In safe mode the browser only sent `sourceId`; resolve it with your manifest.
const resolved = resolvePayloadSources(payload, sourceManifest)

// 3. Build a stable, serializable context for an AI patch prompt.
const context = buildPatchPromptContext(resolved, { maxDomSnapshotLength: 2000 })
```

`validateAnnotationPayload` returns `{ ok: true, payload }` or `{ ok: false, issues }` instead of throwing. `validateSourceManifest` validates the manifest emitted by `@web-annotation/vite`. The safe-mode manifest stays on the trusted backend; it is never shipped to the browser.

When a prompt context carries `source.file`/`line`, `collectRepoSourceContext` reads the relevant source snippets from a local checkout — a building block for a future AI patch step. It calls no AI, generates no diff, and never modifies files:

```ts
import { collectRepoSourceContext } from "@web-annotation/node"

const { files, issues } = collectRepoSourceContext(context, {
  rootDir: "/abs/path/to/repo",
  contextLines: 20,      // lines before/after the annotated line(s)
  maxFiles: 8,           // cap distinct files read
  maxBytesPerFile: 65536 // skip oversized files
})
// files[i] = { file (relative), startLine, endLine, content, annotations }
```

Safety is enforced: only relative paths from the context are accepted; absolute paths, empty paths, and `..` traversal that escapes `rootDir` are rejected; the same file is read once; missing, oversized, or binary files (null-byte detection) become `issues` instead of throwing; and the returned `file` is always repository-relative — absolute paths are used only for internal reads, never surfaced to prompt-facing content. For tests, `readFile`/`fileExists` can be injected.

To keep an AI/custom provider's `diffPreview` from secretly editing files outside what it declared, the kit ships a unified-diff target safety helper. It runs no git, applies no patch, and reads no repository files:

```ts
import {
  collectUnifiedDiffTargetFiles,
  validateUnifiedDiffTargetFiles,
} from "@web-annotation/node"

// Enumerate the repository files a diff would touch (sorted, unique).
collectUnifiedDiffTargetFiles(diff) // => { ok: true, files } | { ok: false, issues }

// Reject any target outside the allow-list (e.g. a proposal's suggestedFiles).
validateUnifiedDiffTargetFiles(diff, ["src/App.tsx"]) // => { ok, files } | { ok: false, issues }
```

It parses both `diff --git a/… b/…` extended headers and plain `--- a/…` / `+++ b/…` headers, skips hunk bodies via exact line counts (so content lines such as `--- something` are never misread as file headers), ignores `/dev/null` while keeping the real path of added/deleted files, and rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, and empty file names with readable `issues`.

## Platform Starter (Ingest API)

`apps/platform-starter` is a minimal HTTP ingest service built on Node's built-in `http` and the Node protocol kit. It receives payloads, validates them, resolves safe-mode sources, collects source snippets from a configured local repo, calls an optional host-provided patch provider, and stores tasks in memory. It ships no built-in model provider and uses no database.

Run it locally:

```sh
pnpm --filter @web-annotation/platform-starter dev
# defaults to http://localhost:4319 (override with PORT)
```

Enable repo source-context collection by pointing the starter at a local checkout:

```sh
WEB_ANNOTATION_REPO_ROOT=/abs/path/to/your/repo pnpm --filter @web-annotation/platform-starter dev
# REPO_ROOT is also supported when WEB_ANNOTATION_REPO_ROOT is not set.
```

When `repoRoot` is configured, the starter also stamps the exported patch artifact's existing `project.commit` field with the repository's current `HEAD`, read through a read-only `git -C <repoRoot> rev-parse HEAD`. This lets the CLI verify repo identity via its base-commit preflight before applying. The commit read is the only git use here: the starter still never applies patches, writes files, commits, or pushes. If the commit cannot be read (e.g. `repoRoot` is not a git repository), `GET /api/tasks/:id/patch-artifact` returns `409 { error: "failed to read repo head commit" }` rather than exporting a fake commit. When `repoRoot` is not set, the export succeeds without adding `project.commit`.

Enable an external HTTP patch provider:

```sh
WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_URL=https://your-ai-backend.example.com/web-annotation/patch \
WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_TOKEN=server-side-provider-token \
pnpm --filter @web-annotation/platform-starter dev
```

`PATCH_PROVIDER_TOKEN` is also supported when `WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_TOKEN` is not set.

Alternatively, enable the built-in OpenAI-compatible model patch provider (both `URL` and `MODEL` are required; the API key is optional and stays server-side):

```sh
WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=server-side-model-key \
pnpm --filter @web-annotation/platform-starter dev
```

Only one patch provider may be configured: setting both `WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_URL` and `WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_URL` fails loudly at startup, and setting `WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_URL` without `WEB_ANNOTATION_MODEL_PROVIDER_MODEL` also fails. Enable the in-memory image upload provider (local development/demos only) with `WEB_ANNOTATION_IMAGE_STORAGE=memory`; a real deployment injects an `ImageStorageProvider` via `createPlatformServer({ imageStorageProvider })` instead.

Then open the task console at `http://localhost:4319/console` (also served at `/`). The console is a single static HTML page (vanilla JS, no framework) with Chinese/English UI switching. It lists tasks, shows a task's payload/prompt-context detail, triggers source-context collection, triggers provider-backed `patch` or deterministic `mock-patch` for tasks without a proposal, renders source snippets, source issues, proposal `summary`, `suggestedFiles`, and `diffPreview`, records review decisions, and displays exported patch artifact JSON. Use it for local verification instead of `curl`.

Endpoints:

- `GET /` or `GET /console` → the task console HTML page.
- `GET /health` → `{ ok: true }`.
- `POST /api/annotations` → body is either a bare `AnnotationPayload v1` or `{ payload, manifest }`. Returns `201 { taskId, status }`, or `400 { error, issues }` on invalid input.
- `GET /api/tasks` → `{ tasks: TaskSummary[] }`.
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` → `{ task }`, or `404` when the id is unknown.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/source-context` → collect repo snippets for the task using the configured repo root. Returns `201 { taskId, sourceContext }` on first collection and `200` on repeat calls, refreshing the stored source context each time; `409 { error }` when `repoRoot` is not configured; `404` when the id is unknown.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/patch` → call `patchProvider.generatePatch({ task, promptContext, sourceContext })`. Returns `201 { taskId, status, patchProposal }` on first success and `200` with the same proposal on repeats; `409 { error }` when no provider is configured; `502 { error, message }` when the provider fails or returns an invalid result; `404` when the id is unknown. Before storing, the provider result is runtime-validated (`summary`, `suggestedFiles`, `diffPreview`, and optional `metadata`) and then the provider's `diffPreview` is checked with the Node kit's `validateUnifiedDiffTargetFiles` against its `suggestedFiles`; a diff that touches an undeclared file, an absolute path, or `..` traversal is rejected with `422 { error: "patch provider returned an unsafe diff", issues }` and no proposal is saved.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/mock-patch` → generate a mock patch proposal. Returns `201 { taskId, status, patchProposal }` on first call and `200` with the same proposal on repeats (idempotent); `404` when the id is unknown.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/patch-review` → body `{ decision: "accept" | "reject" | "changes_requested", reviewer?, note? }`. Records the decision as `patchReview` and moves the task to `patch_accepted` / `patch_rejected` / `changes_requested`. Returns `200 { taskId, status, patchReview }`; `404` when the id is unknown; `409 { error }` when the task has no patch proposal; `400 { error }` for an invalid or missing decision. A repeat review overrides the previous decision (the latest decision wins).
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/patch-artifact` → export `{ artifact }` with `version: "web-annotation.patch-artifact.v1"`, task metadata, prompt annotations, optional source context, `patchProposal`, optional `patchReview`, and safety flags `{ appliesPatch: false, writesFiles: false, requiresHumanReview: true }`. Returns `404` when the id is unknown and `409 { error }` when the task has no patch proposal. Repeat calls regenerate `exportedAt` while reading the stored proposal/review/task data.

A task summary includes `sourceContextStatus`, `sourceFileCount`, and `sourceIssueCount`. `sourceContext.files[].file` stays repository-relative; absolute paths are not returned. Source-context collection reads files only through the Node kit safety checks and still performs no AI call, diff generation, repository write, or Git operation.

A task moves through `received → patch_proposed → patch_accepted | patch_rejected | changes_requested`. The `patchProposal` carries `summary`, `suggestedFiles`, `diffPreview`, `promptContext`, and optional provider `metadata`. The built-in mock path is deterministic and reads no files; the provider path receives `promptContext` and any collected `sourceContext`, validates the returned result shape at runtime, and checks `diffPreview` so it can only touch files inside its own `suggestedFiles` (invalid results and unsafe diffs are rejected and never stored), but the starter package itself still does not include model keys, model SDKs, repository writes, or Git operations. A `patchReview` (`status`, `decidedAt`, optional `reviewer`/`note`) records the human decision only. A patch artifact packages task/proposal/review/source-context data for future apply flows, and its safety flags explicitly state that this starter does not apply patches or write files.

The HTTP provider adapter sends:

```json
{
  "taskId": "task_...",
  "task": {},
  "promptContext": {},
  "sourceContext": {}
}
```

The external provider should return:

```json
{
  "summary": "Short proposal summary",
  "suggestedFiles": ["src/App.tsx"],
  "diffPreview": "--- a/src/App.tsx\n+++ b/src/App.tsx\n...",
  "metadata": {
    "provider": "your-provider"
  }
}
```

The provider result contract is strict and shared by direct injected providers and `createHttpPatchProvider()`: `summary` and `diffPreview` must be non-empty strings, `suggestedFiles` must be a non-empty array of non-empty strings, and `metadata` must be an object when present. Invalid results return a readable `patch provider response is invalid` error and do not create a proposal.

`WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_TOKEN` is sent only from the Platform Starter server to your provider as `Authorization: Bearer ...`; it is not exposed by the browser Runtime SDK.

The server is exposed as a factory for tests and embedding:

```ts
import { createHttpPatchProvider, createPlatformServer } from "@web-annotation/platform-starter"

const { server, store } = createPlatformServer({
  repoRoot: "/abs/path/to/your/repo",
  patchProvider: createHttpPatchProvider({
    endpoint: "https://your-ai-backend.example.com/web-annotation/patch",
    getAuthToken: async () => "server-side-provider-token"
  })
})
server.listen(4319)
```

### Example HTTP Provider And End-To-End Smoke

`examples/provider-http-mock` (`@web-annotation/example-provider-http-mock`) is a runnable, dependency-light reference for how a third-party backend connects over the provider protocol. Its `createMockProviderServer()` accepts the request body that `createHttpPatchProvider()` sends — `{ taskId, task, promptContext, sourceContext }` — and replies with a deterministic, valid `PatchProviderResult` (non-empty `summary`, `suggestedFiles`, a unified-diff `diffPreview` scoped to those files, and an object `metadata`). Each annotation targets its real `source.file` when present, otherwise a stable `mock-unmapped/<annotationId>.md` path so the diff still names a valid repository file rather than a CSS selector. A request with no annotations is rejected with HTTP `400` instead of returning an empty, invalid result. It calls no model SDK, makes no outbound network calls, and reads no API keys.

Run it standalone and point the platform at it:

```sh
pnpm --filter @web-annotation/example-provider-http-mock start   # listens on http://localhost:4400
WEB_ANNOTATION_PATCH_PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:4400 pnpm --filter @web-annotation/platform-starter start
```

The package also ships an end-to-end smoke test (`pnpm --filter @web-annotation/example-provider-http-mock test`) that starts the mock provider on a loopback port, wires it through `createHttpPatchProvider()`, ingests an annotation, calls `POST /api/tasks/:id/patch`, and confirms the resulting proposal passes provider-result validation and diff-target safety and that `GET /api/tasks/:id/patch-artifact` exports a downstream-readable artifact.

## CLI Pull, Preview, Dry-run, Check, Apply, And Branch Commit

`packages/annotation-cli` (`@web-annotation/cli`, bin `web-annotation`) is a minimal local CLI for the `web-annotation.patch-artifact.v1` JSON artifact exported by the Platform Starter's `GET /api/tasks/:id/patch-artifact`. It can pull that artifact over HTTP, preview it, run apply dry-run/preflight and patch-check, apply it with explicit confirmation, and create an explicit local branch/commit. It never pushes or opens a PR/MR.

```sh
# build the CLI, then pull an exported artifact from a running Platform Starter
pnpm --filter @web-annotation/cli build
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js pull <task-id> \
  --base-url http://localhost:4319 --out ./artifact.json

# preview a saved artifact
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js preview --file ./artifact.json

# check whether the artifact is safe to plan against the current clean git repo
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js apply --file ./artifact.json --dry-run

# verify the diff preview with git apply --check, still without writing files
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js apply --file ./artifact.json --check

# apply the patch to the current working tree after explicit confirmation
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js apply --file ./artifact.json --yes

# apply on a new local branch and create a local commit (no push, no PR)
node packages/annotation-cli/dist/main.js apply --file ./artifact.json --yes \
  --branch webannotation/task-example --commit --message "Apply reviewed patch"
```

`pull <task-id> --base-url <platform-url> --out <artifact.json>` requests `<platform-url>/api/tasks/<task-id>/patch-artifact` and saves the artifact locally. The `--base-url` must be an `http:` or `https:` URL (anything else exits non-zero without making a request). An optional `--token <token>` is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and never appears in any output, including errors. The response (the platform wraps it as `{ artifact }`) is validated with the same `validatePatchArtifactInput()` used by `preview`; a non-2xx response, invalid JSON, or a failed validation exits non-zero and writes nothing. On success it writes the bare artifact JSON to `--out` (so `preview --file` can read it back) and prints a deterministic pull report: task id and status, out file, suggested files, review status, and the `appliesPatch: false` / `writesRepoFiles: false` / `createsCommit: false` safety flags. `pull` never applies the patch, runs git, creates a branch/commit, pushes, or opens a PR/MR.

`preview --file <artifact.json>` validates the minimal artifact shape before printing:

- `version` must equal `web-annotation.patch-artifact.v1`.
- `taskId` and `taskStatus` must be present.
- `patchProposal.summary`, `patchProposal.suggestedFiles`, and `patchProposal.diffPreview` must be present.
- `safety.appliesPatch === false`, `safety.writesFiles === false`, and `safety.requiresHumanReview === true` (the export-only contract).

On success it exits `0` and prints a deterministic preview: task id and status, project id, route, proposal summary, suggested files, review status (`unreviewed` when the artifact has no `patchReview`), and the `diffPreview`. On a missing file, invalid JSON, or any failed validation it prints a readable error to stderr and exits non-zero.

`apply --file <artifact.json> --dry-run` reuses the same artifact validation, then runs a read-only git preflight: it checks the current directory is inside a git repository, reads the repo root, and requires `git status --short` to be empty. It also validates every `patchProposal.suggestedFiles` entry as a repo-relative path, rejecting empty paths, absolute paths, and `..` traversal. A successful dry-run prints the repo root, base commit status, suggested files, review status, safety flags (`appliesPatch: false`, `writesFiles: false`, `createsCommit: false`), and the `diffPreview` as preview text only.

`apply --file <artifact.json> --check` reuses the same validation and preflight, enforces the base commit and diff-target safety checks described below, then sends `patchProposal.diffPreview` to `git apply --check`. A passing check prints the repo root, base commit status, suggested files, review status, `Patch check: passed`, and the same no-write safety flags. A failing check exits non-zero with the `git apply --check` error. This command still does not write files or update git state.

`apply --file <artifact.json> --yes` (without `--commit`) is the first command that writes to the current working tree. It requires a clean git repository, validates paths, enforces the base commit and diff-target safety checks, runs `git apply --check`, and then runs `git apply`. It does not run `git add`, create a branch, create a commit, push, or open a PR/MR. Use `--dry-run` or `--check` first when reviewing an artifact manually.

Base commit preflight: if the artifact includes the existing `project.commit` field, every apply path (`--dry-run`, `--check`, `--yes`, and `--commit`) reads the local `HEAD` via `git rev-parse HEAD` and requires it to match before `git apply --check`, `git apply`, `git switch -c`, `git add`, or `git commit` can run. A match is reported as `Base commit: matched` with expected/current commits. A mismatch exits non-zero with a readable expected/current error and performs no write operation. If `project.commit` is absent, the CLI does not fail, but reports `Base commit: not provided` so the user knows repo identity was not verified.

Diff-target safety check: before any `git apply --check` or `git apply`, every apply command (`--check`, `--yes`, and `--commit`) enumerates the files the diff would actually touch and requires that set to equal the normalized `suggestedFiles`. `git apply` honours both `diff --git a/… b/…` extended headers and plain unified-diff `---`/`+++` file headers, so the check parses all of them (hunk bodies are skipped via exact line counts to avoid misreading content lines) and rejects any diff that targets a file outside `suggestedFiles`. This prevents an artifact from declaring one file while smuggling edits to another.

`apply --file <artifact.json> --yes --branch <branch-name> --commit --message <commit-message>` extends confirmed apply into an explicit local branch + commit. `--commit` requires both `--branch` and `--message`; omitting either exits non-zero. The branch name is rejected when it is empty, padded or contains whitespace, starts with `-`, or contains `..` or a backslash, and `src/main.ts` also runs `git check-ref-format --branch` as a final guard. The `--message` is taken verbatim and is rejected when it contains a `Co-Authored-By` or `Generated with` AI-signature trailer; the CLI never invents a default message. Before any write it reuses artifact validation, suggested-file path safety, the clean-repo preflight, the base commit preflight, the diff-target safety check (covering both `diff --git` and plain `---`/`+++` headers), and `git apply --check`, so an unexpected file is never applied or committed. The git write operations are limited to `git switch -c <branch>`, `git apply`, `git add -- <suggested files>`, and `git commit -m <message>`; it never runs `git push`, `git pull`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, or any PR/MR command. On success it prints a deterministic branch/commit report including the branch name, base commit status, committed files, `Patch check: passed`, `Patch apply: applied`, `Git add: staged selected files`, `Git commit: created`, and the explicit `push: false` / `createsPr: false` safety flags.

The core logic is exposed as pure functions for embedding and testing: `validatePatchArtifactInput(input)`, `formatPatchArtifactPreview(artifact)`, `formatApplyDryRunPlan(input)`, `formatPatchCheckReport(input)`, `formatApplyReport(input)`, `formatBranchCommitReport(input)`, `formatPullReport(input)`, `runPreviewCommand(args, deps)`, `runPullCommand(args, deps)`, `runApplyDryRunCommand(args, deps)`, `runApplyCheckCommand(args, deps)`, `runApplyConfirmedCommand(args, deps)`, and `runCliCommand(args, deps)`. `runPullCommand` takes injected `fetchArtifact`/`writeFile` deps so the network and filesystem stay out of the testable core. Apply commands take an injected current commit reader so base commit matching remains testable. `src/main.ts` only adapts `process.argv`/`stdout`/`stderr`, the real `fetch` and file write for `pull`, three read-only git commands (`rev-parse --show-toplevel`, `status --short`, `rev-parse HEAD`), the no-write `git apply --check`, confirmed `git apply` for `--yes`, and the `git check-ref-format` / `git switch -c` / `git add` / `git commit` writes for `--commit`. Push and PR/MR delivery remain planned.

## Payload Shape

Payload example:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "project": {
    "projectId": "web-console",
    "environment": "staging"
  },
  "page": {
    "url": "https://app.example.com/settings",
    "route": "/settings",
    "title": "Settings",
    "viewport": {
      "width": 1440,
      "height": 900
    }
  },
  "annotationGroup": {
    "id": "group_...",
    "mode": "single"
  },
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": "anno_...",
      "message": "Change this button text to Save settings",
      "createdAt": "2026-06-28T00:00:00.000Z",
      "target": {
        "selector": "[data-annotation-id='el_...']",
        "cssPath": "#save",
        "tagName": "button",
        "text": "Submit",
        "rect": {
          "x": 111,
          "y": 319,
          "width": 74,
          "height": 34
        },
        "domSnapshot": "<button id=\"save\" data-annotation-id=\"el_...\">Submit</button>",
        "source": {
          "mode": "source",
          "sourceId": "s_19cu8m6",
          "file": "src/App.tsx",
          "line": 25,
          "column": 9,
          "component": "App",
          "framework": "react"
        }
      },
      "attachments": [
        {
          "id": "att_…",
          "kind": "image",
          "name": "screenshot.png",
          "mimeType": "image/png",
          "size": 20480,
          "width": 800,
          "height": 600,
          "storage": {
            "provider": "server",
            "objectKey": "uploads/screenshot.png",
            "url": "https://cdn.example.com/uploads/screenshot.png"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`source` is omitted when no build plugin is present, when the plugin is disabled, or when runtime capture sets `sourceMetadata: "disabled"`. `attachments` is omitted when no images were attached; it only ever carries an uploaded reference (`storage.url`/`objectKey`), never raw image bytes.

## Planned Ecosystem

```text
packages/
  annotation-core/       Runtime SDK for browser annotation
  annotation-vite/       Current Vite plugin for React source metadata
  annotation-node/       Current Node protocol kit: validation, source resolution, prompt context
  annotation-cli/        Current local CLI: pulls artifacts over HTTP, previews, runs dry-run/check, applies with explicit --yes, and can branch + local-commit (push/PR still planned)

apps/
  platform-starter/      Current minimal HTTP ingest API + bilingual static task console
                         + repo source-context collection
examples/
  playground/            Current local SDK verification page
  vite-react/            Current React source metadata verification page
```

## AI Patch Direction

The intended full workflow is:

```text
select DOM -> write annotation -> submit payload -> backend stores task
-> collect repo source context -> AI proposes patch -> human reviews
-> PR/MR or CLI apply
```

The browser SDK does not include model keys, repository tokens, or backend secrets. AI and repository access belong on the configured backend or platform layer.

## Safety Principles

- The browser SDK must not contain model keys, repository tokens, or backend secrets.
- DOM snapshots should be sanitized before submission.
- Production source metadata should default to safe or disabled modes.
- AI-generated patches must be reviewed by a human.
- PR/MR and CLI delivery should verify repository identity and base commit.
